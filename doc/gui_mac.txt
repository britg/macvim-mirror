==============================================================================
1. MacVim differences					*macvim-differences*

One of the goals of MacVim is to make Vim behave like a proper Mac OS X
application.  For this reason MacVim behaves slightly different from other GUI
ports of Vim.  Most of the modifications are provided in the system gvimrc
file; you can quickly open this file and look at it yourself by typing: >
	:tabe $VIM/gvimrc
Note that this file will be overwritten each time you update MacVim, so it is
better to keep your own modifications inside "~/.gvimrc".

							*macvim-windows*
There is some confusion regarding the term "window" in MacVim since it means
one thing to Vim and another to MacVim.  A "window" in Vim is what opens up
when you type ":sp", whereas a "window" in MacVim is the GUI window which
contains the text view, scrollbars, toolbar and tabline.  To avoid confusion,
the former is referred to as a Vim-window, whereas the latter is simply called
a window.

							*macvim-shift-movement*
Text editors on Mac OS X lets the user hold down shift+movement key to extend
the selection.  Also, pressing a printable key whilst selecting replaces the
current selection with that character.  MacVim tries to emulate this behaviour
by providing several key bindings and by setting 'keymodel' and 'selectmode'
to non-default values.  To disable this behaviour, add the following line to
your "~/.vimrc" (not .gvimrc) file: >
	if has("gui_macvim")
	  let macvim_skip_hig_shift_movement = 1
	endif
<
							*macvim-encoding*
It is not possible to modify 'termencoding' in MacVim; this option is forcibly
set to "utf-8".

							*macvim-drag-n-drop*
Dragging files and dropping them on a window opens those files in tabs in that
window.  This happens even when Vim is in command-line mode.  Holding down
modifier keys whilst dragging is not supported.

							*macvim-default-menu*
The default menu in MacVim has been changed to conform better with the Apple
Human Interface Guidelines (HIG).

Note: The menus are a work in progress.  If you know something about the HIG
and want to contribute to MacVim you could do so by making the menus better.

==============================================================================
2. Starting MacVim					*gui-macvim-start*

The easiest way to start MacVim is by double-clicking its icon in the Finder,
but most users will probably prefer to use the Terminal.  First some Finder
related ways of starting MacVim are described, then Terminal is discussed.
Note that you can put MacVim anywhere on your hard drive, but in this help
file it is assumed that you have put it inside your /Applications folder.

MacVim automatically registers itself as an editor of several standard file
formats.  This enables you to double-click a file to open it with MacVim (if
it is not associated with another program), or to right-click a file to bring
up the "Open with" menu.  You can also drag and drop files onto the Dock icon
to open them in tabs in a new window, or you can drop them in an already open
window to open the files in tabs in that specific window.  Finally, you can
use Mac OS X System Services to open files in MacVim, see |macvim-services|.

There are essentially two ways to start MacVim from Terminal: either call the
Vim binary with the -g switch >
	/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g file ...
or use the "open" command (which is of limited use since it cannot be used to
pass parameters to Vim) >
	open -a MacVim file ...

In order to save you from having to type the entire path every time you start
MacVim, add the following alias to "~/.profile": >
	alias gvim='/Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim -g'

Once in terminal Vim it is possible to start MacVim by using the following
command:
	:gui [++opt] [+cmd] [-f|-b] [files...]
Note: Forking ("-b") currently does not work.

==============================================================================
3. Special colors					*macvim-colors*

The colors in MacVim are defined in two dictionaries inside the "Resources"
folder of the application bundle (MacVim.app/Contents/Resources).  It is
possible to add more colors by modifying these files.  Color names are case
insensitive when accessed from Vim, but in the dictionary they must be
lowercase.

							*SystemColors.plist*
There are only a few system colors that can be accessed from Vim.  These
colors are defined in the dictionary "SystemColors.plist".  This dictionary
stores (key, value) pairs where the key is the name of the color and the
value is an NSColor selector name.

The most useful system colors are: >
	MacSelectedTextBackgroundColor
	MacSecondarySelectedColor
The former is the "Highlight Color" which can be changed in the "Appearance"
section of the System Preferences.  The latter is the selection color used by
a Cocoa application when it is not in focus.

							*Colors.plist*
Apart from the system colors, it is also possible to use the colors listed in
the dictionary "Colors.plist". The key in this dictionary is the name of the
color and the value is an RGB value on the form #rrggbb stored as an integer.

==============================================================================
4. Menus						*macvim-menus*

							*:menukeyequiv*
MacVim has a special way of binding keys to menu items that differs from other
Vim GUI ports.  A menu binding is called a "key equivalent" in Mac OS X
terminology, this is displayed on the right side of a menu item.  The
":menukeyequiv" command is used to set the key equivalent of a menu item.
This command takes two parameters, the first names the menu item to bind to,
the second gives the key combination.  For example: >
	:menukeyequiv File.New\ Tab <D-t>
This sets the key equivalent of the "New Tab" menu item under the "File" menu
to Cmd+t.

Note that key equivalents:
	* should always contain the Cmd modifier flag (<D-...>)
	* take precedence over normal mappings made with ":map"
	* can only be modified during startup (e.g. in .gvimrc)

							*:action*
It is typical for menu items in Cocoa applications to bind to Objective-C
selectors.  To support this, MacVim introduces the ":action" command.  This
command takes the name of an action message as its only parameter.  (An action
message is an Objective-C message with "void" return type and a single
parameter of type "id".)  For example, the "New Window" menu item on the
"File" menu is created in the following manner: >
	:an 10.290 File.New\ Window :action newWindow:<CR>

Note 1: A menu item which is bound to ":action" will automatically be bound to
that action in all modes (as if ":an" was used).  It is not possible to bind
to ":action" in one mode only.
Note 2: The action is "nil-targeted", which means it is passed down the first
responder chain.

							*Actions.plist*
Some action messages would not be suitable to call from within Vim, so there
is a dictionary called "Actions.plist" (in the Resources folder of the
application bundle) which contains all actions that may be called.  The key in
this dictionary is the name of the action message (case sensitive), the value
is not used.

==============================================================================
5. System services					*macvim-services*

MacVim supports a few system services.  These can be accessed from the MacVim
submenu in the Services menu.  For services to work, MacVim.app should be
located in the /Applications folder.  (You might have to logout and then login
again before Mac OS X detects the MacVim services.)

These are the currently supported services:
* New Tab Containing Selection: Opens a new tab in the topmost window and
  pastes the currently selected text in that tab.  A new window will be
  opened if necessary.
* Open Selected File in Tab: If the selected text represents a file
  name, then the corresponding file is opened in a new tab in the topmost
  window.
* Open Selected File in Window: Same as the above, but always open in a new
  window.

==============================================================================
6. Known bugs/missing features				*macvim-todo*

Here are some of the bigger bugs in MacVim.  Of course there are others, but
these are ones that are know and/or which were judged major.

- Composing characters are not supported, they will mess up the display
- Only "utf-8" is supported for 'enc'
- Sometimes multibyte characters look "too wide", i.e. they overlap the
  following character.  It might help to change 'ambiwidth'.
- Printing
- No find/replace dialog

If you find new bugs then add a new issue at http://code.google.com/p/macvim/
or post your findings to the vim_mac mailing list.  If you are missing feature
X in MacVim then voice your opinion on the vim_mac mailing list; it might be
simple to implement, but unless somebody asks for a particular feature then
there is little incentive to add it.

==============================================================================
7. Hints						*macvim-hints*

In this section some general (not necessarily MacVim specific) hints are
given.

Scenario: You try opening a bunch of files in tabs but not all files get
opened in their own tab.
Solution: To get around this, set 'tabpagemax' to something big in your
.gvimrc file (e.g. ":set tabpagemax=100").

Scenario: You want to open a file in a tab in an already opened window, but
typing "gvim filename" in Terminal opens it up in a separate window.
Solution: Use the |--remote-tab| switch.  If you have several windows open you
might have to specify which window you want the file to open in by using the
|--servername| switch.  The title of a window usually ends in something like
"VIM" or "VIM3" --- this is the server name of that window.  So to open a file
named "foobar.txt" in a window whose title ends in "VIM3" you would type (the
order of the arguments matters): >
	gvim --servername VIM3 --remote-tab foobar.txt
For more information, consult the |client-server| manual page.

Scenario: Selection doesn't work the way you are used to.
Solution: See |macvim-shift-movement|.

Scenario: You can't find the information on MacVim you thought should be in
this manual page.
Solution: Post your question on the vim_mac mailing list and wait for an
answer.
