    <!--
    To add a new release:

    * add a new <item> below (copy an old one)
    * Adapt the <title>
    * Adapt the <description>
    * Adapt the <pubDate> (format 'Day, dd Mon yyyy hh:mm CET')
    * Adapte <enclosure>, make sure to update the url, length, saprkle:version
      and sparkle:shortVersionString attributes.

    Sparkle honors the following user defaults:

    * SUFeedURL overrides the value in Info.plist (if we want to offer several
      appcasts in the preferences one day ("latest", "stable" for example).

      This means that for testing you can do

          defaults read org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL  # note this down
          defaults write org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL file:///Users/you/testcast.xml
            # !!! note the three '/' after 'file:
          # test test test
          defaults write org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL previousvalue
          # or, to use some default setting for the url,
          defaults delete org.vim.MacVim SUFeedURL

    Sparkle usually assumes a naming scheme of name_versionnumber.tar.bz2 .
    Instead, you can also provide a sparkle:version="2.0_rc2" attribute on
    the enclosure and name the package as you like. You can (and should) also
    provide a sparkle:shortVersionString="User-facing version string"
    attribute that corresponds to CFBundleShortVersionString. Sparkle uses
    CFBundleVersion to determine the current application version.

    Sparkle supports updates in zip, tar, tbz, tgz, or dmg format.

      <title>Snapshot 27 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 27 released</h1>
<p> This is the first snapshot compiled on the new Mac I bought with money
    donated from MacVim users!  There were problems with compiling universal
    binaries with Ruby and Perl support on PPC/Tiger so I was hoping to be able
    to include these now that I have Intel/Leopard.  The good news is that Ruby
    support is now included, but Perl still is problematic and I had to drop
    TCL support.  I will try to get these working in a future snapshot.
    </p>

<p> Here is the list of changes since snapshot 26:
<ul>
  <li> 'fuoptions' now support setting the background color while in
       full-screen mode, check ":h 'fuopt'" (patch by Enno LÃ¼bbers) </li>
  <li> &lt;D-w&gt; shows confirmation dialog when buffer is modified </li>
  <li> setting 'antialias' from gvimrc now works </li>
  <li> zooming a window no longer causes it to move downwards </li>
  <li> the File menu now contains a "Recent Files" submenu; note that only
       files opened from Finder or with the ":browse" command are added to this
       list, and not files opened with e.g. ":e" (patch by Nico Weber) </li>
  <li> includes latest Vim patches and runtime files </li>
</ul>

      <title>Snapshot 26 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 26 released</h1>
<p> This snapshot contains a fix to the bug which caused the first window to
    open in the wrong position as well as an initial version of the new MacVim
    icon.  </p>

      <title>Snapshot 25 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 25 released</h1>

<p> This snapshot adds support for two new options: 'antialias' and
'fuoptions'.  The former lets you turn text antialiasing on or off (it's
on by default), the latter can be used to make the view maximize when
full-screen is entered.  See the built-in help for more information (:h
'anti' and :h 'fuopt'). </p>

<p> Another minor addition is that &lt;C-c&gt; and &lt;C-v&gt; work with
block-wise selections (do note that &lt;C-v&gt; behaves like "P", not "p").
Also, &lt;D-w&gt; now works in ex-mode and in a command-line window. </p>

<p> Here is the list of changes since snapshot 24:
<ul>
  <li> support 'antialias' option (Jjgod Jiang) </li>
  <li> add option 'fuoptions' to control resizing when full-screen is entered
      (Nico Weber) </li>
  <li> fixed bug where transparency setting was lost after leaving full-screen
      (Nico Weber) </li>
  <li> help menu contains MacVim help and website link </li>
  <li> &lt;D-w&gt; now works in ex-mode and in command-line window </li>
  <li> :macaction command supports command-line completion (Nico Weber) </li>
  <li> copy/paste respects block selections (requested by George Harker) </li>
  <li> window no longer cascades from preferences panel </li>
</ul>

      <title>Snapshot 24 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 24 released</h1>

<p><em> The input manager bundled with snapshot 23 contained a bug which could
lead to other apps crashing on startup.  If you have installed the input
manager, then you are strongly advised to update now and install the new input
manager (via the Integration preference pane). </em></p>

<p> Changes since snapshot 23:
<ul>
  <li> The mouse cursor has higher contrast in insert mode (when bg=dark). </li>
  <li> The layout of the Integration preference pane has been updated. </li>
</ul>

      <title>Snapshot 23 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 23 released</h1>

Changes since snapshot 22:

<ul>
  <li> The preferences panel has been updated with an "Integration pane".  This
      can be used to easily install (and uninstall) the "Edit in ODBEditor"
      input manager.  The input manager enables you to use MacVim to edit text
      in any Cocoa text field (e.g. you can use MacVim to edit emails in Mail).
      Please read the warning on the Integration pane before installing the
      input manager.  (Patch by Nico Weber.) </li>
  <li> The "Login Shell" preference has been updated so it should now work with
      most shells.  This option ensures that environment variables (e.g. $PATH)
      are set properly.  You should enable it if you ever need to issue shell
      commands from within MacVim.  (Patch by Ben Schmidt.) </li>
  <li> Added MMZoomBoth user default.  Enable this if you prefer the window to
      maximize in both directions when you press the green "maximize button"
      (hold down Cmd to temporarily restrict resizing to the vertical direction
      only).  (Requested by Brian McKee.) </li>
  <li> Added Cmd-Ctrl-z as key equivalent for "Window->Zoom" (this is the same
      key equivalent as in iTunes) </li>
  <li> The Vim runtime files have been updated to the latest version </li>
  <li> MacVim recognizes files with .patch and .diff extension </li>
  <li> The mouse cursor in insert mode has higher contrast (when used with dark
      backgrounds).  (Requested by Enno et al.) </li>
  <li> Line numbers (:h 'number') are brighter when bakground=dark.  (Requested
      by Ted Pavlic) </li>
</ul>

      <title>Snapshot 22 released</title>
      <description><![CDATA[
<h1>MacVim snapshot 22 released</h1>

<p><em>This snapshot replaces the broken snapshot 21.  If you installed build 21
  then please update immediately.</em></p>

<p>Changes since snapshot 20:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix forking bug which caused snapshot 21 to lock up OS X</li>
  <li>The macvim color scheme changed so that line numbers look better when
    the background is dark (enable line numbers with :set number; set dark
    background with :set bg=dark)</li>
  <li>Improved support for Voice Over (enable with &lt;D-F5&gt;)</li>
  <li>System bell support (see :h 'vb' on how to turn it off)</li>
  <li>MacVim no longer associates to .plist and .dict since these may well be
    in binary format</li>
  <li>Added Find Next &lt;D-g&gt;, Find Previous &lt;D-G&gt; and Use Selection
    for Find &lt;D-e&gt; menu items</li>
  <li>Track pad scrolling is now force sensitive</li>
  <li>Added help section on preferences</li>
  <li>Preferences panel updated (also no longer hides when MacVim loses focus)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The most exciting new addition in this snapshot is support for &lt;D-g&gt;.
It repeats the last search you made in any other application (that supports the
Find Pasteboard).</p>
<p>This is very useful if you have several windows open in MacVim...try
searching for something in one window (using "/"), then switching to another
window and hitting &lt;D-g&gt; for an example (after having pressed &lt;D-g&gt;
once you can of course use "n" to repeat the search).</p>
